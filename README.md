DevKit is a browser-based learning companion and knowledge manager designed for developers. It allows users to capture and manage coding notes, code snippets (with syntax highlighting), resource links, and even interact with a simulated AI assistant. Built entirely with front-end technologies, this project reflects mastery of DOM manipulation, event-driven logic, local storage, and interactive UI components.
 Key Features
Multi-type Entries: Save entries as Notes, Code Snippets, or Resources

Code Highlighting: Uses highlight.js to format and display code beautifully

AI Assistant Panel: Simulated chat panel for code explanations or AI-based responses (ready for OpenAI API integration)

Search & Tag Filters: Dynamically filter notes by tags or keywords

Edit/Delete Functionality: Easily update or remove existing entries

Copy-to-Clipboard: Quick code copying with visual feedback

Responsive Modal UI: View full notes or snippets in a focused modal

Fully Local: All data is stored using localStorage, no backend required
